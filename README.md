## Privacy-Preserving Onion Site Popularity Measurement

This page provides details about a small, short-term, safe, and secure measurement study of the popularity of [Tor](https://www.torproject.org) onion sites. In particular, we aim to show that it is feasible to estimate the popularity of onion sites by using machine learning techniques to classify accesses to the Facebook onion site front page, while providing strong user privacy guarantees.

We believe that this study is safe: we only learn the total site usage, with added noise. Because we collect data from Tor middle relays, we can not learn anything about individual users. Because we use PrivCount, we do not learn site usage on single relays, or total site usage without any noise. All unblinded data is kept on the collecting relay, and is automatically destroyed after processing. See the [safety section](#what-are-we-doing-how-is-this-safe) for more details.

### Who are we?

We plan to list our names, affiliations, and contact info here soon. However, this measurement study is part of a larger research paper; most research conferences require submission without author attribution in order to avoid introducing biases into the paper review process. We link to this page in our paper, and so listing our names here could be grounds for immediate rejection. We plan to add our names, affiliations, and email addresses here once our paper clears the submission process.

That being said, you can contact the people operating the relays used in this study by following the links in the relay section below, and if you click around enough you can probably find the github repository maintainer. Program committees should avoid searching too hard in order to preserve the integrity of the review process.

### What is the general idea?

We are working on understanding how machine learning techniques that have traditionally been used to fingerprint websites for the purpose of deanonymizing Tor users can instead be used to measure the popularity of Tor onion sites. Although website fingerprinting is usually done by someone in a position to observe part of the network path between the client and its guard (including someone that runs the guard itself), our popularity measurement is less intrusive and only requires running middle relays.

Our popularity measurement involves:
  1. running a middle relay and observing circuits;
  1. guessing if an observed circuit is a hidden service circuit (already done by [Kwon et al.](https://www.usenix.org/node/190967), albeit from a guard node position);
  1. for hidden service circuits, guessing the position of the relay in the circuit (we focus on the middle position next to the
client-side guard); and
  1. for hidden service circuits observed from the correct relay position, guessing the onion service website (i.e. the Facebook login page) based on a trained classifier.

If guessing the onion site from the middle is successful, then it can be used to discover onion service popularity by measuring the frequency with which each onion site is accessed. The goal of our small study is to provide a proof-of-concept by measuring the popularity of a single onion page: the Facebook onion site login page.

### What are we doing? How is this safe?

Our measurement study explicitly **prioritizes user safety as a primary goal**. We practice data minimization, limit measurement granularity, and provide additional security to the measurement process as described below. We have incorporated feedback from the [Tor Research Safety Board](https://research.torproject.org/safetyboard.html) into our methodology.

More details coming soon...

### Which relays are involved in the measurement?

The following relays are part of our PrivCount deployment. The data collected by these relays is blinded and securely aggregated while also being protected by differential privacy. Each individual relay learns nothing except the final combined results from all relays.
